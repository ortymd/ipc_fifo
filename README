This is a simple application that shows communication of 2 processes via fifos.

***** BUILD *****
$ make all

***** RUN *****
"make all" builds 2 applications: "user0" and "user1". These (when started) are the processes that communicate over fifos.
simply run each application in a SEPARATE shell and start messaging.

shell_0 $ ./user0
shell_1 $ ./user1
